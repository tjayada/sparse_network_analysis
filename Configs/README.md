# Configs
Configuration files to obtain and train each sparse model. To reproduce the results of this thesis only change the random seeds and sparsities. The synflow\_rnd\_fc file produces random networks with good structures, to obtain truely random networks change the pruning argument in the synflow files from "synflow" to "rand".
