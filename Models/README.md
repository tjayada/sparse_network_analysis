# Models
This directory contains the implementations of models. The lottery_resnet.py is the implementation of the SynFlow authors, while resnet_kaiming.py is the implementation of the Gem-Miner authors.
The mlp.py file contains both SynFlow and Gem-Miner implementations (Gem-Miner adapted by me), as well as the random-but-good-structure network.
